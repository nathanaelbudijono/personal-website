# Description
Dermaga.in, a burgeoning startup, serves an a bridge linking boat owners with their potential customers.
This web page was designed to streamline and enhance the boat rental process, providing a seamless and efficient
experience for boat owners and customers alike.

# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to support the core operations of the startup, focusing on facilitating
transactions and offering comprehensive information regarding boat rentals.

# Software Stack
This project was build using NextJs framework, TypeScript as programming language, tRPC as API layer, TailwindCSS as CSS framework, 
and Prisma as ORM, with MySQL as database. We also use firebase storage for storing pictures. In this project,
I am responsible to create boat forms, update forms, and boat detail page. I also responsible to create multiple
functions and API endpoints to support the core operations of the startup.

# Spotlight
This is my first collaborative project, as I a junior developer at Bendega. This site was built with 
2 other people. I learned a lot regarding git workflows and how to collaborate with other people in a project.

# Challenges
The biggest challenge in this project is learning tRPC. I had no prior knowledge regarding tRPC, and I had to learn
it in a short amount of time. I spent most of my time reading github issues and documentation about tRPC. Another challenge is
using firebase to store pictures. I had to learn how to use firebase storage and how to upload/delete pictures to firebase storage.

# Lesson Gained
Through this project I learned alot about complex tech stacks. I' glad that I had the opportunity to learn about tRPC and firebase.
I also learned how to collaborate with other people in a project. I learned how to use git properly and how to use git branches.
