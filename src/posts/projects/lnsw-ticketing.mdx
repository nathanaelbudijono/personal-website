# Description

During my internship at the Ministry of Finance, I had the privilege of contributing to project. As part of the _Lembaga National Single Window_, I took on the responsibility of developing a reporting application with fellow teamates [Dzulfikar](https://github.com/dzulfikarfath02), [Riky](https://github.com/rikyindrasaktii), [Alka](https://github.com/alfathahuga), and [Aidil](https://github.com/Bhedil). Leveraging the power of NextJs, TypeScript, Prisma, TailwindCSS, and PostgreSQL.

# Objective

The objective of this project was to create an upgraded reporting application for the _Lembaga National Single Window_ system, catering to users who faced challenges while utilizing the system. By transitioning from the previous generation, which solely utilized React and ExpressJS. The aim was to provide a more comprehensive and user-friendly platform. This application facilitates streamlined issue reporting and resolution, empowering users to communicate difficulties effectively.

# Lessons Gained

Through this project, I gained valuable insights and acquired new skills that have significantly enriched my development capabilities. Prior to this endeavor, I had limited exposure to NextJs, TypeScript and Prisma; however, this project provided me with the opportunity to grasp their intricacies and apply them effectively. Moreover, I developed a deep understanding of the importance of meticulous application planning from the user's perspective, which played a pivotal role in optimizing the overall functionality.
