# Description
LNSW Ticketing is a prototype ticketing web page for the ministry of finance. 
Web page is used for public users that uses Indonesian National Single Window and experience trouble.

# Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a web page that will help users to report their problem to the ministry of finance.

# Software Stack
This project is build using NextJs framework, TypeScript as programming language, TailwindCSS as CSS framework,
and Prisma as ORM, with PostgreSQL as database. In this project, I was resposible for building the front-end and back-end.

# Spotlight
## First Internship
2023 Summer, I was accepted to intern at the Lembaga National Single Window (LNSW) as a software engineer intern. 
LNSW is a non eselon government agency that is under the ministry of finance. It focuses on export and import licensing.
## Experience
My time as an intern at LNSW not only provided a valuable learning experience but also offered ample opportunities to connect with new people. 
The collaborative and inclusive environment at LNSW allowed me to network with professionals from diverse backgrounds.
However, the journey to the LNSW office was an adventure in itself. Jakarta is notorious for its traffic jams, 
but navigating through Jakarta's notorious traffic jams to reach the LNSW office became a test of patience and a lesson in adaptability.

# Challenges
LNSW is currently transitioning to its second generation using NextJs framework. Prior to this endeavor, I
had no experience with NextJs. I had to learn NextJs and TypeScript. I spent most of my time watching youtube tutorial
regarding the subject. I also learn how to use Prisma as ORM and PostgreSQL as database. Creating a flexible reusable component was
also a challenge, luckily I was able to learn from my senior and reading [Steven](https://trenom.id)/[Theodorus Clarence](https://theodorusclarence.com) blog.

# Lesson Gained
Through this project, I gained valuable insights and acquired new skills that have significantly enriched my development capabilities. 
Moreover, I developed a deep understanding of the importance of meticulous application planning from the user's perspective, 
which played a pivotal role in optimizing the overall functionality.
