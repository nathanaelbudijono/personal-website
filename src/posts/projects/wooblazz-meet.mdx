# Description
Wooblazz Meet is a powerful video conferencing application designed to facilitate seamless communication.
Much like Google Meet, it allows users to create virtual meeting rooms and share the invite link with others for easy access.
The app comes equipped with a range of features to enhance the meeting experience, including support for virtual backgrounds, screen sharing, chat rooms, and automatic transcription.
Whether for personal or professional use, Wooblazz Meet provides a comprehensive solution for video calling needs.

# Objective
The primary objective of building Wooblazz Meet is to integrate it as a key feature within the Wooblazz CRM platform.
Wooblazz CRM is a comprehensive tool designed to assist sales teams in monitoring their progress and managing their sales pipelines more effectively.
The addition of a video call feature is intended to enhance the CRM's functionality by providing sales professionals with a quick and efficient way to connect with their clients face-to-face, without the need to switch between different applications.

# Software Stack
This project is built using the Next.js framework, with TypeScript as the primary programming language, ensuring a robust and type-safe development environment. 
For real-time communication, we leverage WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication), which is a native technology that enables peer-to-peer connections directly between users' browsers.
This allows for high-quality video, audio, and data sharing without the need for any external plugins or downloads.

To manage data and maintain application state across different users and sessions, we use WebSocket technology.
WebSocket is a protocol that enables full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection between the client and server. 
Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which are one-way and short-lived, WebSockets allow for continuous, bidirectional data exchange, making it perfect for real-time applications like this one.
By using WebSocket, we ensure that any changes in state or data are immediately reflected across all connected users, providing a smooth and synchronized user experience.

# Spotlight
This is my first full-time role as a software developer, and Iâ€™m currently working at Looyal Indonesia (at the time of this blog is being written), a Software as a Service (SaaS) start-up.
Looyal specializes in offering a diverse range of innovative business solutions tailored to meet the needs of companies ranging from micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to large corporations. 
I applied for this position as a way to gain practical experience and engage in meaningful work, rather than focusing solely on my final thesis as a final-year student. 
This opportunity allows me to develop my skills and contribute to real-world projects while navigating the transition from academic life to professional practice.

# Challenges
When I first started this job, I had no prior knowledge of WebRTC or WebSocket, which posed a significant challenge. 
Learning these technologies from scratch required a steep learning curve, but I was fortunate to have the support of my coworkers, who guided me through the process. 
Initially, we developed Wooblazz Meet using PeerJS, a library that simplifies WebRTC implementation, to speed up development. 
However, as we progressed, we realized that we needed more flexibility and control over the connections, leading us to switch to native WebRTC.
This transition was a critical turning point, as it demanded a deeper understanding of how WebRTC works at a lower level. 
Although it was challenging, the switch allowed us to tailor the video call functionality to better meet our specific needs.
As for WebSocket, I had heard of it before but never had the opportunity to use it in a project.
Learning how to implement WebSocket for real-time data exchange was another hurdle, but through hands-on experience, I managed to overcome it.

# Lesson Gained
One of the most valuable lessons I learned from this project is the importance of continuous learning and adaptability.
As a software developer, it's essential to embrace the mindset of being a lifelong learner, always ready to step out of your comfort zone and explore new technologies.
Working with unfamiliar tools like WebRTC and WebSocket taught me that the initial challenge of learning something new can lead to significant growth, both in technical skills and problem-solving abilities. 
This experience has reinforced the idea that being adaptable and open to change is crucial in the ever-evolving field of software development.
