# Description
The Navigator User Media API enables web applications to access the user's camera and microphone.
 This powerful API is widely utilized in various applications, such as video conferencing platforms.
By granting web applications the ability to interact with hardware components like the camera and microphone, you can seamlessly integrate audiovisual capabilities into their web experience.

# Overview
Using the Navigator User Media API can sometimes be a challenging experience, especially when it comes to managing the camera.
One common frustration users encounter is dealing with the camera's behavior, such as ensuring it is turned off properly.
A particularly perplexing issue arises with the camera's light indicator, which can occasionally fail to turn off even after the camera has been deactivated.
This issue not only creates confusion but also raises concerns about privacy and security. Here is how you can ensure the camera is turned off correctly.

Create a state of localVideo initialized to null. It will eventually hold a reference to a video element that will play the local media stream.
localMediaStream is a ref that holds the MediaStream object, which represents the media captured from the user's camera and microphone.

<Copy/>

```tsx
// src/components/pages/index.tsx

const [localVideo, setLocalVideo] = React.useState<HTMLVideoElement | null>(null);
const localMediaStream = React.useRef<MediaStream | null>(null);
```

We then would want to setup our local media stream using useEffect. `setupLocalMedia` is an asynchronous function that requests access to the user's media.
If access is granted, it creates a video element, sets it to autoplay and muted, so it doesn't echo, and assigns the media stream to the video element's srcObject.
The video element is then saved to the state variable localVideo.

<Copy/>

```tsx
// src/components/pages/index.tsx

React.useEffect(() => {
  const setupLocalMedia = async () => {
    if (localMediaStream.current) return;
    try {
      localMediaStream.current = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
        audio: true,
        video: true,
      });
      const localMedia = document.createElement("video");
      localMedia.autoplay = true;
      localMedia.muted = true;
      localMedia.srcObject = localMediaStream.current;
      setLocalVideo(localMedia);
    } catch (error) {
      alert(
        "You chose not to provide access to the camera/microphone, demo will not work."
      );
    }
  };
  setupLocalMedia();
}, []);
```

Appending the Video Element to the DOM. This useEffect hook runs whenever localVideo changes.
If localVideo is not null, it appends the video element to the DOM element with the ID local-video-container.

<Copy/>

```tsx
// src/components/pages/index.tsx

React.useEffect(() => {
  if (localVideo) {
    const container = document.getElementById("local-video-container");
    if (container && !container.hasChildNodes()) {
      container.appendChild(localVideo);
    }
  }
}, [localVideo]);
```
A `toggleCamera function checks if the media stream is active. If it is, it toggles the video track on and off.
If the video track is enabled, it stops the track and sets track.enabled to false.
If the video track is disabled, it requests a new media stream and replaces the old video track with the new one.

<Copy/>

```tsx
// src/components/pages/index.tsx

const toggleCamera = () => {
  if (localMediaStream.current) {
    localMediaStream.current.getVideoTracks().forEach(async (track) => {
      if (track.enabled) {
        track.stop();
        track.enabled = false;
      } else {
        await navigator.mediaDevices
          .getUserMedia({ audio: true, video: true })
          .then(function (stream) {
            if (localMediaStream.current) {
              localMediaStream.current.getVideoTracks()[0].stop();
              localMediaStream.current.removeTrack(
                localMediaStream.current.getVideoTracks()[0]
              );
              localMediaStream.current.addTrack(stream.getVideoTracks()[0]);
            }
          })
          .catch(function (err) {
            console.log(err);
          });
      }
    });
  }
};
```

Now you can create the JSX structure for the video element and a button to toggle the camera.
To style the video element, it is recommended to style it globally.

<Copy/>

```tsx
return (
  <main>
    <div id="local-video-container" />
    <button onClick={toggleCamera}>Toggle camera</button>
  </main>
);
```

Dont forget to configure reactStrictMode to false at `next-config.js` or else it might not work accordingly.
That's it you can now control your or user camera with proper security and privacy.
