# Description

MongoDB is a popular and versatile open-source database system designed for managing and storing large volumes of data in a flexible, schema-less format. It belongs to the NoSQL family of databases, which prioritizes scalability and agility. MongoDB's distinctive feature is its ability to store data in JSON-like BSON format, allowing for complex data structures and dynamic schemas. Renowned for its speed and scalability, MongoDB is often chosen for projects that demand high-performance data storage and retrieval.

# Overview

To setup a connnection from your application to MongoDB, you will need to to have a [MongoDb](https://mongodb.com) account. Complete the initial setup and choose create a database. Choose connections, then drivers and copy the connection string to your clipboard. You will need to install a dependency called mongoose.
In this section, I will show how to establish a connection from NextJs and ExpressJs.

## NextJs

<Copy />

```tsx
// src/lib/connection.tsx

import { connect, connection } from "mongoose";
const options: any = {
  useUnifiedTopology: true,

  useNewUrlParser: true,
};

export const connectToDatabase = async () => {
  if (!connection.readyState) {
    console.log("Connected to database");
    connect(`${process.env.MONGO_URI}`, options);
  }
};
```

## ExpressJs

<Copy />

```js
// src/lib/connection.js

const mongoose = require("mongoose");

async function connected() {
  await mongoose.connect(`${process.env.MONGO_URI}`);
  console.log("connected to database");
}

module.exports = { connected };
```

<Copy />

```js
// src/lib/server.js

const express = require("express");
const { connected } = require("./database/connection");

const app = express();

const PORT = 8000;

connected().then(() => {
  try {
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log("Server is online");
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Cant connect to server");
  }
});
```

Keep in mind this is the quickest way to setup a connection to MongoDb, you might want to read the full documentation to learn more about the options you can pass in.
