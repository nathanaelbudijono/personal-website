# Description
End-to-end testing is a methodology in software testing where the complete flow of an application is tested from start to finish to ensure that all components of the system work together as expected.
Cypress, on the other hand, provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools to write, automate, and debug tests effortlessly.

# Overview
To get started, install the package with the following command.

<Copy/>

```ts
npm i cypress
```

You can open Cypress from your project using the following command. 

<Copy/>

```ts
npx cypress open
```

If this is your first time running Cypress, it will take some time to install the cypress to your device.
It will also open the following application. We are going to choose E2E Testing.

It will ask you to configure some stuff and choose a browser to run the test. 
Choose Create a new spec. It will create a `cypress` directory in your project and scaffold out the necessary files and folders for you.

In you `cypress` directory, open `e2e` folder and choose the test file. `test.cy.ts`. Here i provide a simple test for my personal site.

<Copy/>

```ts
describe("E2E Testing Personal Site", () => {
  it("Display index", () => {
    cy.visit("http://localhost:3000");

    cy.get('[data-testid="name"]')
      .should("exist")
      .should("have.text", "Nathan!");
  });

  // it("Display stuff", () => {
  //   cy.visit("your-url");

  //   cy.get('[data-testid="your-id"]')
  //     .should("exist")
  //     .should("have.text", "your-text");
  // });
});
```
This test will visit my personal site at and check if the name Nathan is displayed correctly at `/`. If the test is successful, it will display the following message at cypress application.

As simple as that! we have created an end-to-end test for our application.
Of course there are more test feature that you can discover like buttons, input, and many more.
You can check the documentation at their [official website](https://www.cypress.io).
