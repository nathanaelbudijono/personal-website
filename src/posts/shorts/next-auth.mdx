# Description

NextAuth is a complete open-source authentication solution for Next.js applications.
It is designed from the ground up to support Next.js and Serverless. It supports authentication providers like Auth0, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and more.

# Overview

This authentication library leverages the concept of sessions to ensure secure user access.
Next-Auth operates by creating and managing sessions, which serve as the bridge between a user's identity and the resources they have access to on your site.
A session, in this context, can be thought of as a temporary but reliable token that confirms a user's identity.
First, we will be creating a protected layout component.

<Copy />

```tsx
// src/component/protected-layout.tsx

import * as React from "react";

import { useSession } from "next-auth/react";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

type Props = {
  children: React.ReactElement;
};

/*
  add the requireAuth property to the page component
  to protect the page from unauthenticated users
  e.g.:
  OrderDetail.requireAuth = true;
  export default OrderDetail;
 */

export const ProtectedLayout = ({ children }: Props): JSX.Element => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { status: sessionStatus } = useSession();
  const authorized = sessionStatus === "authenticated";
  const unAuthorized = sessionStatus === "unauthenticated";
  const loading = sessionStatus === "loading";

  React.useEffect(() => {
    // check if the session is loading or the router is not ready
    if (loading || !router.isReady) return;

    // if the user is not authorized, redirect to the login page
    // with a return url to the current page
    if (unAuthorized) {
      console.log("not authorized");
      router.push({
        pathname: "/",
        query: { returnUrl: router.asPath },
      });
    }
  }, [loading, unAuthorized, sessionStatus, router]);

  // if the user refreshed the page or somehow navigated to the protected page
  if (loading) {
    return (
      <div className="h-screen flex justify-center items-center">
        Loading app...
      </div>
    );
  }

  // if the user is authorized, render the page
  // otherwise, render nothing while the router redirects him to the login page
  return authorized ? <div>{children}</div> : <></>;
};
```

We will modify the \_app.tsx file to use the protected layout component.

<Copy />

```tsx
// src/pages/_app.tsx

import "@/styles/globals.css";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";

import { SessionProvider } from "next-auth/react";
import { ProtectedLayout } from "@/component/protected-layout";

type AppPropsWithAuth = AppProps & {
  Component: {
    requireAuth?: boolean;
  };
};

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppPropsWithAuth) {
  const { session } = pageProps;
  return (
    <SessionProvider session={session}>
      <main className="bg-zinc-800 text-white">
        {Component.requireAuth ? (
          <ProtectedLayout>
            <Component {...pageProps} />
          </ProtectedLayout>
        ) : (
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        )}
      </main>
    </SessionProvider>
  );
}
```

Here is the implementation of the page that you want to protect.

<Copy />

```tsx
// src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx

import Layout from "@/component/layout";

import { useSession } from "next-auth/react";

export default function Dashboard() {
  const { data: session } = useSession();

  return (
    <div>
      <Layout className="flex justify-center items-center h-screen flex-col">
        <h1>Dashboard page</h1>
        <p>Welcome, {session?.user?.name}</p>
      </Layout>
    </div>
  );
}

Dashboard.requireAuth = true;
```

Thank you for reading! I have created a [repository](https://github.com/nathanaelbudijono/next-auth) with the code used in this article & next-auth implementation with discord provider.
