# Description

Dark mode has been one of the biggest trends in user interface that has gained significant traction. It offers so much advantages. It can reduce your eye strain, especially in low-light conditions. Additionally, dark mode can improve battery life and enhance readability, as it provides a higher contrast between text and background.

# Overview

To setup dark mode on NextJs, you will need to install next-themes. It is a lightweight, zero-runtime CSS-in-JS library that allows you to theme your app using CSS variables. It is also compatible with Tailwind CSS. What I love from this libary is that you can set up your button anywhere.

On your tailwind config file add this.

<Copy />

```ts
 darkMode: "class",
```

<Copy />

```tsx
// src/components/navbar.tsx

import clsx from "clsx";
import {useTheme} from "next-themes";
import { CiDark, CiSun } from "react-icons/ci";

export default function Navbar() {
  const { setTheme, theme } = useTheme();
   const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme(theme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark");
  };
  return (
    <main>
        <h1>My Page</h1>
        <button
            onClick={toggleTheme}
            className={clsx(
              "px-2.5 py-2 text-lg rounded-md hover:bg-blue-200 text-black",
              "dark:hover:bg-orange-200 dark:text-white",
              "transition-all duration-200 ease-in"
            )}
          >
            {theme === "dark" ? <CiSun /> : <CiDark />}
        </button>
        </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

On you app page. Wrap your component using ThemeProvider, it saves your preferences to local storage. _Dont worry clsx is just a tailwind CSS libary so that you have a clean CSS_.

<Copy />

```tsx
// /src/pages/ _app.tsx;

import "@/styles/globals.css";
import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="light">
      <Navbar />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

If you are using NextJs add these line of codes at your navbar/button file to prevent hydration error.

<Copy />

```tsx
const [mounted, setMounted] = useState<boolean>(false);

useEffect(() => {
  setMounted(true);
}, []);
if (!mounted) {
  return null;
}
```
