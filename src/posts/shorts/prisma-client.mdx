# Description

Object-relational mapping ORM is a way to align programming code with database structures.
ORM uses metadata descriptors to create a layer between the programming language and a relational database.
It thus connects object-oriented program OOP code with the database and simplifies the interaction between relational databases and OOP languages.

# Overview

One of the most popular ORM tools is Prisma Client.
The Prisma client is an auto-generated library that can be used as an alternative to Prisma bindings to access data in your applications.
It is available in JavaScript, TypeScript, Flow and Go.

Your application should generally only create one instance of PrismaClient. How to achieve this depends on whether you are using Prisma in a long-running application or in a serverless environment.
The reason for this is that each instance of PrismaClient manages a connection pool, which means that a large number of clients can exhaust the database connection limit.

## TypeScript

<Copy />

```ts
// lib/prisma.tsx

import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

interface CustomNodeJsGlobal {
  prisma: PrismaClient;
}

declare const global: CustomNodeJsGlobal;

const prisma = global.prisma || new PrismaClient();

if (process.env.DATABASE_URL === "development") global.prisma = prisma;

export default prisma;
```

## JavaScript

<Copy />

```js
// lib/prisma.js

import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

let prisma;

if (process.env.DATABASE_URL === "production") {
  prisma = new PrismaClient();
} else {
  if (!global.prisma) {
    global.prisma = new PrismaClient();
  }
  prisma = global.prisma;
}

export default prisma;
```
